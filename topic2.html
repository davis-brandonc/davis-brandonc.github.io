    <H2><b>Object Creation Functions</b></H2>
    <p>In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object</p>
        <li>Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</li>
        <li>Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</li>
        <li>Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)</li>
        <li>Dates are always objects</li>
        <li>Maths are always objects</li>
        <li>Regular expressions are always objects</li>
        <li>Arrays are always objects</li>
        <li>Functions are always objects</li>
        <li>Objects are always objects</li>
    <p>All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.</p>
    <p>Below is the script for creating a movie as an object. The script will create the object and it will also assign some properties to the movie. The script will call the object and some of it properties and then display them. Below the script is the out</p>

        <p id="object"></p>
        <script src="scripts/object.js"></script>
    
    
    <H2><b>Inheritance</b></H2>
    <p>Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions</p>
        <p>In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:</p>
        <li>Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
        <li>Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
        <li>Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
        <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
        <li>Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
     <p>Below is the script for a sample of how conditional statements work. As you can see I have to statments with condtions. The first one is conditional what time in the day it is. If it before noon, certain text is displayed. If it is after noon other text is diplayed. I also did a conditional statment for which day of the week it is before Wednesday certain text is diplayed. If it is after wednesday other text is displayed. If it is before is created with the types of fish. Click the "Click Me" button to see what happens when the code below is executed</p>

        <br><button onclick="conditionalFunction()">Click Me!</button>
        <script src="scripts/conditionalstatments.js"></script>
    <H2><b>Properties</b></H2>
    <p>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</p>
    <p>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</p>
    <H2><b>Parameters</b></H2>
    <p>Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.</p>
    <p>Below is the script for a sample of how parameters work. As you can see in the script we are setting the paramaters for A, B, C, D, E. We are giving each of those a value and then doing a math equation using the parameters set. Click the "Click Me" button to see what happens when the code below is executed</p>
        <img src="Images/parameters.PNG" alt=parameters>
        <p>The Answer to the above script using the parameters assinged is: <p id="test123"></p>
       <script src="scripts/parameters.js"></script>
    <H2><b>Methods</b></H2>
    <p>JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
    <p>Below is the script for a sample of how Arrays work. As you can see an array is created with the types of fish. Click the "Click Me" button to see what happens when the code below is executed</p>
        <img src="Images/arrays.PNG" alt=arrays>
        <br><button onclick="arraysFunction()">Click Me!</button>
        <p id="test"></p>
        <script src="scripts/arrays.js"></script>
    <p>JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.</p>
    <H2><b>Instantiation</b></H2>
    <li>Arrays with named indexes are called associative arrays (or hashes).</li>
    <li>JavaScript does not support arrays with named indexes.</li>
    <li>In JavaScript, arrays always use numbered indexes.</li>
