    <H1> Using XMLHTTPRequest to Consume a JSON Web Service</H1>
    <p>A common use of JSON is to read data from a web server, and display the data in a web page.</p>
    
    <p>An EventHandler that is called whenever the readyState attribute changes. The callback is called from the user interface thread. The XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange property contains the event handler to be called when the readystatechange event is fired, that is every time the readyState property of the XMLHttpRequest changes.</p>
    
    <p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) is an API that can be used by JavaScript, JScript, VBScript, and other web browser scripting languages to transfer and manipulate XML data to and from a webserver using HTTP, establishing an independent connection channel between a webpage's Client-Side and Server-Side.</p>
    
    <p>The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server. The XMLHttpRequest object is a developers dream, because you can: Update a web page without reloading the page.</p>
    
    <p>A common use of JSON is to exchange data to/from a web server.
       When receiving data from a web server, the data is always a string.
       Parse the data with JSON.parse(), and the data becomes a JavaScript object.</p>
